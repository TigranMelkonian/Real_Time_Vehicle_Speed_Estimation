# Real_Time_Vehicle_Speed_Estimation
Real-time Video-based vehicle speed estimation is a foundational component in constructing the perception, planning, and control architectures of autonomous driving systems. In this paper we present a monocular video-based vehicle speed estimation system based on a proposed deep CNN architecture that considers optical flow and depth disparity as input information. We aim to train and evaluate the performance of our proposed deep CNN, optical flow based, architectures and prove that combining depth disparity information with optical flow vectors can generally improve predicted vehicle speed mean squared errors and accuracies when compared to using optical flow alone and the quality and complexity of a deep CNN responsible for learning optical flow can have a significant influence on vehicle speed prediction performance. Our best optical flow architecture in combination achieved a mse of 1.25 for predicted vehicle speed against a dedicated validation set containing  ground truth speed values.
